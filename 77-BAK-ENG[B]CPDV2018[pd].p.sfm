from drowning.
Lamech died (before his father) in the
year of his age 777.
Mathusala died, aged 969, immediately
before the flood, as seemeth most probable.
The same year of the world 1656, the 17th
day of the second month, Noe with his three
sons, his wife and their wives, in all eight
persons, and seven pair of every kind of
clean living creatures, and two pair of unclean,

After his death, the superiority of
the children of Israel descended not to
hi-* sons, but to his brethren, and rested
in Levi the third brother, living longest
of all the twelve, to the age of 137
years, Exod. 6. v. 16. whose genealogy
is there declared, to show the descent
of Aaron and Moses.
Moses an infant of three months was
put in a basket on the water, and taken
thence by Pharao's daughter, nursed by
his own mother, and brought up in
Pharao's court. Exod. 2.
At the age of forty years he went to
his brethren to comfort them: where
killing an Egyptian that oppressed an
IsraelFte, he was forced to flee into
Madian. Exod. 2.
After other forty years, God appeared
to Moses in a bush fuming and not
consuming; sent him into Egypt with
power to work miracles, and to bring
the children of Israel out of that bondage,

Pharao and the Egyptians resisting,
were plagued with sundry afflictions.
At last the Israelites were delivered,
and Pharao with all his army drowned.

The tabernacle, with all things pertaining
thereto, was prepared in the
first year, and erected the first day of
the second year of their abode in the
