This done, rising early in the morning, he builds an altar at the foot of the mountain : he sets up twevle pillars, according to the twelve tribes, and sends young men of the first-born, as ministers of those holy things, (before the institution of the Levitical priesthood,) which sacrifice first for sin, and then as. thanksgiving to the Lord. And after Moses had read the book of the covenant, he takes of the blood of the calves and goats so offered, and sprinkles the book and all the people of those twelve statues representing them: and so performs a solemn covenant between God and his people. Moses and Aaron, with Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the ancients of Israel, go up into the mount, and behold there the glory of God. The rest returning, Moses with his minister, Joshua, remained there, and wait six days, when, on the seventh day, God speaks to him ; and there he continues forty days and forty nights, (including the six days before the Lord's appearance,) eating no meat, nor drinking water all that while, \rq (Deut. ix. 9,)\rq* where he received God's command with regard to the frame of the tabernacle, the priests' garments, their consecration, sacrifices, and other particulars in these and the six following chapters. See \rq Exod. xxi. to xxxi.\rq* — At the end of forty days, God gives Moses the two tables of the law, written with God's own finger, bidding him get down quickly, for that the people had already made themselves a molten calf to worship. Moses pacifies God by prayer, and goes down ; when, seeing the people keeping a festival in the camp in honour of their idol, he -breaks the tables at the foot of the mount ; for which the Jews keep a fast to this day. Moses having burnt and destroyed the idol, slew twenty-three thousand -of the idolaters by the hands of the Levites. \rq Exod. xxxi. and xxxii.\rq* — God commands Moses to frame new tables of stone, and bring them with him to the mount.

At this God threatens to destroy them ; but by Moses's prayer, is prevailed upon to spare them. He, nevertheless, denounced, that all who are twenty years old, Caleb and Joshua excepted, shall die in the wilderness. Those who raised the evil report are all destroyed by sudden death. Some, endeavouring to enter the promised land, contrary to God's command, are smitten by the Amalekites and Canaanites. \rq Num. xiv.\rq*

Here Mary, sister of Moses and Aaron, died. The people again murmur against Moses and Aaron for want of water. God orders Moses to speak to the rock, and it should yield a sufficiency of water ; but owing to his impatience and diffidence, he utters something or other unadvisedly with his lips, and for which transgression both he and Aaron are debarred from entering the promised land. In the fifth month of this year Aaron dies, on tne top of Mount Hor, aged 123, leaving Eleazar, his son, to succeed him in the high priesthood. \rq Num. xx.\rq* — The people, for murmuring, are plagued with fiery serpents, of which many die: upon their repentance, God commands a brazen serpent to be made, that as many as should look upon it should live.
